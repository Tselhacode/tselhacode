## Hi there, I'm Tenzin! Welcome to my page!👋

I'm a self-taught software developer with a passion for finding interesting intersectionality between coding and social sciences. I love building applications that solve real-world problems. I come from a non-traditional background as I have a background in philosophy. I have over two years of experience as a software developer at a museum where I was the only full-stack developer and got to work on these projects WW II Interactive Map and Suitcase Project. These projects are currently on display at the museum!

I am a continuous and fast learner.
